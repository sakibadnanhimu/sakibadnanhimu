### Hi there ðŸ‘‹




I'm a fresh graduate in Computer Science. 
I'm currently looking for software engineering jobs to start my career in the industry.
I'm very excited about the journey and hope to learn a lot as we advance. 
I have experience working in Web Development, System Analysis and Design, Artificial Intelligence, Database Design and Computer Security. 
I have built several projects using these technologies during my graduation period.
